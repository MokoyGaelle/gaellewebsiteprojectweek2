<b>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with 
the tools you used?</b> <br> <br> 

<ul>
<li>Visual Studio Code (VSC)-  helped write the code for the website easily and clearly </li> 

<li>Trello  - Helped plan and analyze the project as well as assess the speed at which the plan is going </li> 

<li>Github - The latest version of the project is pushed onto Github at the end of the day </li> <br>
</ul>


<b> 2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello </b><br><br>

<p>All three tools are very easy to use and simple to understand. It gives the ability to write simple code 
(VSC) that can be tested as an html format online to see any errors made to keep improving the code and the
website design. Planning and analysis on Trello was fairly simple and straightforward as the lists 
complemented each other and showed me which step to take next. Github stopped me from creating several 
different versions of the same file as the latest version was always saved onto the platform. </p> <br><br>

<b>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project. Are you happy with your website? </b> <br> <br>

<b>Strengths: </b> <p>I think that the  website is very simple, the information is clear and easy to read.Also 
the colours do not clash, which makes the website stremline and easy to go through. The navigation is 
simple to use. All the pictures are the correct size and well formatted. All the internal links are working. </p><br>

<b>Weakness: </b>
<p>The site is not interactive enough, the images could’ve been in a carousel or a video could’ve been 
    added. The headers on the page could’ve been used a little more, I only used h1 throughout the site. 
    The website is “safe” there no experimentation and it is very functional.</p> <br>

<p>As a whole the website is as desired and reflects my personality, simple with a lot of intricacies and straight to 
the point.</p><br> <br>

<b>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project. </b><br> 

<p>The suggestions below are not so much improvements but rather suggestions on the development 
    of the website. </p><br> <br> 

<b>Add videos - </b>  <p>videos on how the tools and softwares. For example: one video coulod be about how to
create a Github account and doing a push at in order to save the latest version. Another video on how to 
create a Trello project board and how to use it. And one more video on using VSC from day one until the 
end of the project., This video will be sped up sligtly because it will be over a week's worth of footage.</p>
<br> <br>

<b>Change background - </b> <p>use more that one image as a background so that the gallery is throughout the site rather than just in small 
sections of the websites. </p> 
<br><br> 

<b> Change the font - </b> <p>use a font to give the website some -personally rather than using a standard font, for the site to be 
more feminine. For example use: </p> <br>

<ul>
<li class= "dancing">Dancing Script </li> <br>
<li class= "great">Great Vibes </li><br>
<li class= "parisienne">Parisienne </li> 
</ul> </ul>
<br> 

<b>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</b> <br> <br>

<b> Preparing appropriate content for your site:</b> <p>Read up on project management, as well as the tools
that were used during the project. Took the  time to understand how trello works and used it to make sure 
that every step of creating this website were completed. </p> <br> <br>

<b>Organise and combine information needed for web pages including different platforms:</b> <p>The information
was found several Project management website (references provided) as well as using VSC and Github to 
create the website and Trello for project planning. </p> <br> <br>

<b>Select and using appropriate editing and formatting techniques for clarity and good navigation: </b> 
<p>Using the correct coding language to create legible webpages rather than just one full page of 
information that will be difficult to read. Using the heading h1 on the page only once to make the main 
heading stand out </p>  <br> <br>

<b>Changing file formats for documents if necessary to display on your site error free pages that are 
fit for purpose:</b> 
<p>Through VSC, the code is update where and when necessary to configure the outcome. Each web page is 
tested as HTML to see if every webpage is working correctly. Images were formatted in order to be the 
right size for the pages and to fit the sections of the site. </p>
