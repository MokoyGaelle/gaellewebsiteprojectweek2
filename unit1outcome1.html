<b>1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business </b>
<br>
<p>IT is a key factor for innovation and innovation is the path to business success and growth. 
Technology can be used for anything from data protection to communication to business lead generation.</p>
<br>
<br>
<b>Communications</b> <br>
<p>In any organisation people communicate using technology. It could either be a VoIP phone system or emails,  
running those communication systems as well as keeping the conversation secure is what IT is important for. 
Without them, it would be impossible to operate your business.</p>
<br>
<br>
<b>Inventory</b> <br>
<p>Every business needs to be organized, to know when stock is low, 
and to be able to tell if things are going missing. With IT, additional stock can automatically be 
ordered when necessary, with inventory management system linked to the POS system, to keep this closed-loop 
running smoothly. </p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
<b>Data Storage </b> <br>
Office probably don’t have rows of filing cabinets anymore. Now, data is stored in the cloud or in some other digital server,which should be well-maintained and secure.
<br>
<br>
<b>Information Management </b> <br>
Data is kept so that it can be used to track sales, manage expenses, monitor activity, and maintain customer relationships.
<br>
<br>
<b>1.2  Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully </b> <br>
<br>
In order to have a successful project you would need to: <br>
<ul>
<li>Identify the project </li> 
<li>plan the project </li> 
<li> Define goals and objectives </li> 
<li>Define tasks </li> 
<li>Build the team </li> 
<li>Create a timeline </li> 
<li>Get feedback and adjust the project accordingly </li> 
</ul>

<br>
<b>Project Management methodologies </b> <br>
<br>
<p>There are 7 project management methodologies. As there is not one size fits all  
methods as all projects differ in size, time and funding allocation. </p> <br>

<ul>
<li> Agile is made up of 12 values and principles, Agile works 
best with projects that require flexibility, that are complex and uncertain.</li><br>

<li> Scrum Comprises of 5 values: commitment courage, focus, openness and respect. Scrum is there to develop, 
deliver and sustain complex projects through collaboration, accountability  and iterative progress. </li> <br>

<li> Kanban has 6 general principles of practice which are: <br> <br>
<ul>
<li>Visualization </li> 
<li>Limiting work in progress </li> 
<li>Flow management </li> 
<li>Making policies explicit </li> 
<li>Using feedback loops </li> 
<li>Collaborative or experimental evolution </li> 
</ul>
<br>
Kanban works  by using visual cues that signal various stages of the development process. 
The cues involved in the process are a Kanban board, Kanban cards, and Kanban swimlanes for extra bit of organization. </li> <br>

<li> Lean aims to provide more value whilst using less resources. It identifies three types of waste; muda, mura, and muri,
also known as the 3Ms. Often mistaken for specializing in manufacturing industries, Lean methodology is ideal for 
any business or organization that is not looking for a process as such, but is interested in transforming how they 
conduct business. </li> <br>
<br>

<li> Waterfall is a linear, sequential design approach where progress flows downwards in one direction — 
like a waterfall. The methodology emphasizes that you’re only allowed to move onto the next phase once you have 
finished the current one.  The phases are followed in the following order: <br>
<br>
<ul>
<li> System and software requirements </li> 
<li> Analysis </li> 
<li> Design </li> 
<li> Coding </li> 
<li> Testing </li> 
<li> Operations </li> <br>
</ul>

Waterfall is best suited for: Larger projects that require rigid stages and deadlines, or recurrent project 
where chances of surprises during the development process are relatively low. </li> <br>

<li> Six Sigma aims to improve quality by reducing the number of errors in processes by identifying what is not working and 
then removing it from the process. It is best suited for larger organisations that want to improve quality and 
efficiency through a data-driven methodology. </li> <br>

<li> Project Management Book of Knowledge (PMBOK), Through the PMI, comes the PMBOK which is not quite a methodology 
but a guide detailing a set of standards that characterize project management. It states that there are five process groups 
that are prevalent in almost every project. Best suited for: Because it’s more of a reference guide than an actual project management 
methodology, you can’t implement PMI/PMBOK to a project. However, it can be used for when you want to weigh in on 
the best practices for your project.</li> <br>

<li> Project Management Software. Although there is an array of softwares available, These are the ones 
I am familiar with. <br> 
<br>
<ul>
<li>Basecamp: With a simple interface, you can use this software to write to-do lists, create multiple projects, 
share files, schedule important dates, and have discussions. </li> <br>
<li>Trello: let’s you organize to-do-lists and discussions visually through the use of collaborative board.</li> <br>
<li>Zoho Projects: Comes equipped with tasks and milestones, calendar and meetings, time tracking, reports, 
forums, file storage, and even a chat-in app to improve collaboration. </li> <br>
</ul>

</li> <br>

<li> Time Management: prioritise and delegate tasks. </li> <br>


</ul>

<p><b>1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your 
Trello board. </b> </p><br> <br>
<p>Before planning, every aspect of the website needs to be researched. Once the research has been done, a list can 
be created. The trello board for this project has been split into 4: </p><br> 
<ul>
<li> To do </li> 
<li> Doing </li> 
<li>Completed </li>
<li>To review/ redo </li> <br>
</ul>

<p> Each list is pretty much self explanatory, this will help keep abreast of the tasks and show how fast or slow the project 
is going.  The link below will show how the trello board is set. </p><br> <br>

<b> 1.4  Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why? </b> <br> 
<br>
<p>Project failure can happen in any organization and to any project. There are an infinite number of reasons for failure. 
Sometimes it’s out of the control of a project manager and/or team members. Sometimes failure is controllable.
Projects most commonly fail because there is a lack of attention and effort being applied to seven project performance 
factors: </p><br>
<ul>
<li><b>Focus on business value, not technical detail. </b> <br> 
This involves establishing a clear link between the project and the organizations key strategic practices. The project 
plan needs to cover the planned delivery, the business change required and the means of benefits realization.</li> <br>

<li><b> Establish clear accountability for measured results. </b> <br> 
It is necessary to establish a reasonably stable requirements baseline before any other work goes forward.
Requirements may still continue to creep. In virtually all projects there will be some degree of “learning what the 
requirements really are” while building the project product. </li> <br>

<li><b>Have consistent processes for managing unambiguous checkpoints. </b> <br> 
Successful projects typically have software measurement programs for capturing productivity and quality historical data 
that can be used to compare it against similar projects. The lack of effective quality centered mechanisms can be a major 
contributor to both cost and schedule overruns. </li> <br>

<li><b>Have a consistent methodology for planning and executing projects. </b> <br> 
There should be a detailed plan developed before any release date of a project is announced. Inadequate planning is one 
of the major reasons why projects spin out of control. </li> <br>

<li><b>Include the customer at the beginning of the project </b> <br> 
and continually involve the customer throughout. It has been observed that successful projects occur when end users 
(customers) and the project members work as teams. Projects are less likely to fail if there are informed customers 
giving meaningful input during every phase of the project. </li> <br>

<li><b>Manage and motivate people so that project efforts will experience a zone of optimal performance throughout its life. </b> <br> 
A project team made up of higher paid people with the right specialized skills is worth more per dollar than a group of 
lower cost people who need weeks or months of training before they can start to be productive. </li> <br>

<li><b>Provide the project team members the tools and techniques the need to produce consistently successful projects. </b> <br> 
The project team must be skilled and experienced with clear defined roles and responsibilities. 
If not, there must be access to expertise which can benefit those fulfilling the requisite roles.</li> <br>

</ul>

<p><b>1.5  Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of 
technology for the job? </b> </p> <br>
<br>
<p>Choosing the correct software is like choosing a new member of staff, it has to be what the company needs, must fit in 
with members of staff But more importantly help the company rather than hinder growth. </p> <br><br>

<p><b>Analyze Your Business Needs</b> <br>
Conduct an analysis of where the business is at and where you would like the business to go and how investing in new 
technology will help it go further. Common areas for improvements in technology include for businesses include: </p><br> <br>

<ul>
<li>Accounting and Financing  </li> 
<li>Order Taking and Tracking  </li> 
<li>Database Management  </li> 
<li>Communication (both internal and with customers)  </li> 
<li>HR Management  </li> <br>
</ul>

<p><b>Choose Technology That Grows with Your Business</b> <br>
Purchasing and implementing new technology into a business is likely to be expensive, so this needs to be carefully 
considered before being done. A good method to find this out to find out what competitors are using and how it is 
benefiting them. There is always a risk that the technology may not be what the business needs. To avoid that risk, 
consider leasing the product/ software before making a purchase. This can act as a way of testing the technology before 
committing. </p><br><br>

<p><b>Always Think in Terms of Need </b> <br>
This is a point that needs to be reiterated, as the needs of the business always come first. Therefore always put the 
needs of the business first rather than the desire of the staff is important in the effective implementation of new 
technology within the business. </p><br><br>

<p><b>Have a Backup Plan </b> <br>
Technology is unpredictable and you always need to plan for what may go wrong at any given time. Making sure that a plan 
is put in place in order to keep the business going  will create a recovery strategy in the event of a technological 
misapp. </p><br><br>

<p> <b>Get Support </b> <br>
Having or outsourcing an IT support team to help in case of technical difficulties is also very helpful. Once this 
individual or service is in place, ensure that you have a thorough protocol for staff to report any IT problems and 
make sure that your employees are familiar with it. </p><br><br>

<p><b>Training</b> <br>
If you have invested time and money in finding the correct software and technologies for your organisation, you also 
need to do th]e same for the employees. It would be pointless to have up to date technology if the staff are unable to 
use it. Developing an ongoing training process for the organisation can be beneficial to make the most of your investment.</p>
<br><br> 

<p>
<b>1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. How has Trello 
    helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control. </b> </p> <br>
<br>

<p>For the project to work, using a project management tool that keeps track of what has been and needs to be done during 
the project is always effective to keep track of everything. Trello is a web based list making application that creates a 
of lists that shows the steps of the project. The board for this project has been created as a to-do list.<br><br>

Github provides hosting for software development version control using Git. As Github track changes in any set of files, 
the latest files will always be updated once it is pushed through git. <br><br>

Trello helps to not repeat the same tasks whilst Github always has the most updated version of the project. With that the 
project is moving smoothly and effectively.</p><br><br>

<p><b>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects? </b> </p>
<br> <br>

<p>Data is the most valuable commodity in the world, and the Data Protection is there to make sure that this is not abused. 
The Data Protection Act 2018 controls how your personal information is used by organisations, businesses or the government 
and GDPR. According to the law, everyone responsible for using personal data has to follow strict rules called 
‘data protection principles’. They must make sure the information is:</p><br>

<ul>
<li> used fairly, lawfully and transparently </li> <br>
<li> used for specified, explicit purposes</li> <br>
<li> used in a way that is adequate, relevant and limited to only what is necessary </li> <br>
<li> accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date </li> <br>
<li> kept for no longer than is necessary</li> <br>
<li> handled in a way that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unlawful or 
unauthorised processing, access, loss, destruction or damage</li> <br>
</ul>

<p>Any projects done online must follow GDPR these rules but also make sure that the people concerned are aware that you have
their data. As well as that, if the people concerned ask to know how much and what type of information you have on them, 
this should be done within a month of them making a request.  At times, organisations can withhold information, 
for example if the information is about: </p><br>

<ul>
<li> the prevention, detection or investigation of a crime </li> <br>
<li> national security or the armed forces </li> <br>
<li> the assessment or collection of tax </li> <br>
<li>judicial or ministerial appointments </li> <br>
</ul>

<p>An organisation does not have to say why they’re withholding information. If there is concern that information is 
being misused, a complaint can be written to the Information Commissioner’s Office.</p> <br> <br> <br><br><br>
