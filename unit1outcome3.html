    <p><b> 3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and 
        efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done 
        it in teams? </b> </p> <br>

        <p>These are the benefits of using Github, Trello, Slack and VSC. They are fast and convenient way to
        communicate and pass or receive information (Trello and Slack).  For example, mistakes can be 
        explained via slack and the right code can be passed across to the rest of the class. With VSC you 
        can directly check how the webpage looks and make any amends immediately.</p> <br>
        
<b>Benefits:</b> <p>The information will always be there for myself to go back on as it is now part 
of a network online (Github).  Github is a server that always has the latest version of the  work once
it has been pushed on there. The work will not be changed or amended always I share it with someone. <br><br>
The tools improve efficiency and productivity: Trello helps stay on top of tasks, slack helps share 
information to other and Github saves the latest version of the work done.</p> <br> 
        
        <b>Drawbacks: </b>
<p>Although, Trello can be updated and a push is done on Github, the information that is sent on slack is 
permanent and once it is sent and the other party has received it, this could be bad if the information is 
incorrect.<br><br>
        
Misinterpretation: At times visual cues are needed to understand what is being said and information sent
electronically through Slack can be misinterpreted by the receiver.  <br><br>
        
Data storage: the downside of using an external server is that if it isn’t working for a certain period of
time, there will be no access to the work which in return can delay the project. </p><br><br>
        
<b>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency </b> <br> <br>
        
<p>Productivity means getting this done, efficiency means doing those things right. Linking this to my project, 
in order to be productive worked on the aspect of the project that I knew I could do efficiently and 
effectively, which was the written segment of the work. I self as that, I set self imposed deadlines to 
make sure that I can assess how quickly the work is moving along. The Trello board was useful as I could 
move the done tasks along the board. </p> <br> 
        
<p>In order to be efficient, I made sure that I wasn’t multitasking and working on the coding and the written
content at the same time. Again the Trello board is useful as I know what I moved things along the board. 
VSC was useful as any changes made can be checked immediately for errors by running the html file to see 
how it looks.  As well as that Github was useful because the latest of the file was saved onto the server.

<b>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do 
differently next time? </b><br> <br> 
        
<p>If I were to do this project again, I would actually start with the coding part. By creating the layout of
the pages and how I want it to look and then adding the content. Therefore on this project, I chose to be 
productive before being efficient. Next time I will be efficient before being productive. <br>  <br>

Also I will take the time to ask more questions slack. I tend to try and figure it out before asking for 
help, which can slow down productivity. Therefore making use of the wider team will be and be efficient so 
that I can be more productive. </p> <br> <br>
        
<b>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions </b><br> <br> 

<p>Testing for digital solutions is testing if the website is doing what it is supposed to do. When testing 
the site, I am looking for errors, inconsistencies in fonts and sizes, that all of the links are working  
as well as the correct positioning of images. Digital testing is making sure that the website does exactly 
what it is supposed to do. <br>
