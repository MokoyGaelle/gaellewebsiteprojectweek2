<b>1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page - tell us how the page looks </b> <br> <br> 

<p>My website has 6 pages, “About me” , “Unit 1, outcome 1”, “Unit 1, outcome 2”, “Unit 1, outcome 3”, 
“Unit 2, outcome 1” , “References”. <br> 
The pages all have the same layout and a simple yet feminine colour scheme with the image of a person t
yping on a laptop in the background. The menu with the six pages is at the top (below the website name) 
and at the bottom of the website after all the written content. <br> <br> 

The menu is in the colour misty rose with 6 white boxes that state the names of the pages. The first page,
“About me” is a synopsis and a little bit about me which acts as an introduction to the site. <br> <br> 

“Unit 1, outcome 1”, answers 7 questions about improving productivity with IT. Questions 5, 6 and 7 in 
particular have a lot of information on the strategies and concepts of project management as well as the 
legal side of IT which is GDPR. <br> <br> 

“Unit 1, outcome 2”, answers 5 questions where I review the use of the tools and development of the project.
On this section the focus is on Slack, Trello, Github and VSC and how these have helped me accomplish the 
tasks for the project. <br> <br> 

“Unit 1, outcome 3”,  has four questions that include productivity and efficiency when working on a 
project but also reflection on what could’ve been done differently in the project. <br> <br> 

“Unit 2, outcome 1” , which is this section, is a small section explaining in words what the website 
looks like and the content. <br> <br> 

“References”, This page has links to all the webpages I have visited whilst working on this project.

<b>1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites </b> <br> <br>

<p>According to the BBC, this is what copyright entails: <br> <br>

“Copyright is legal right that protects the use of your work once your idea has been physically expressed. 
The current copyright legislation in the UK is the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988. <br> <br>

Copyright law lays out a framework of rules around how that work can be used. It sets out the rights of 
the owner, as well as the responsibilities of other people who want to use the work.Every time you watch 
an online clip, listen to music, read your favourite blog, or enjoy something creative, you are 
interacting with copyright in some way.  Copyright protects most creative things you create, too.” </p> <br> <br>
         
<p>Other constraints that affect a website include but are not limited to, cost (the budget either being too 
low or not define) The time frame not being assessed correctly ( the project may take longer and as such 
cost more money), as well as the requirements of the project not being clear (the stakeholder is not 
voicing clearly what he/she wants from the website).

<p><b>1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with 
disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them</b></p><br> 

<p>When websites and web tools are properly designed and coded, people with disabilities can use them. 
Making the web accessible benefits individuals, businesses, and society. If an organization’s web product 
is not accessible to a disabled person, that person may have grounds for making a claim against the 
organization under the Equality Act 2010 or the Disability Discrimination Act 1995.</p> <br> 

<b> Visual impairement:</b>  <p>Images that do not have alt text,complex images (e.g., graphs or 
charts) that are not adequately described, video that is not described in text or audio, 
tables that do not make sense when read serially (in a cell-by-cell mode) to name a few <br> <br>

To access the Web, most individuals who are visually impaire rely on screen readers (software that 
reads text on the screen with a synthetic voice) and/or refreshable braille displays (a device that 
dynamically displays lines of text on the screen in braille). Some people who are blind prefer text-based 
browsers to graphical browsers.</p> <br> 

<b>Hearing impairement: </b> <p> The lack of captions or visual cues for the hearing impaired makes access 
to the web difficult, especially when listening to an audio format. to reticfy this issue using caption or
making a transcript available is useful.
</p> <br>

<b> physical disability:</b> <p>This is motor skills so the ability to hold a laptop or 
type the information using a keyboard or using a mouse. individuals with such disabilities can make use of 
a specialized mouse; a keyboard with a layout of keys that matches their range of motion, as well as
voice-recognition software. These assistive technologies help access and interact with the information on 
Web sites.</p><br> 


<b>cognitive impairement:</b> <p> This is more vast as it includes learning disabilities, seizure disorders 
and psychiatric disorders as well as intelligence impairement. <br> <br>

<p>Learning disabilities:Individuals with learning disabilities may have difficulty processing written
language or images when read visually, or spoken language when heard, or numbers when read visually or 
heard. Specific learning disabilities can affect the ability to focus.To use the Web, people with learning disabilities may rely on getting information using different methods
at the same time. <br> 

For instance, someone who has difficulty reading may use speech output to facilitate 
comprehension, while someone with an auditory learning disability may use captions to help understand an 
audio track. An individual who is highly distractible may need to turn off animations on a site in order 
to be able to focus on the site's content.</p> <br> <br>
 
<p>Impairments of intelligence:
Some individuals learn more slowly or have difficulty understanding complex concepts which includes lack of 
clear or consistent organization of Web sites, use of unnecessarily complex language on Web sites,
lack of graphics on Web sites. <br> To use the Web, people with impairments of intelligence may take more time on a Web site, may rely more on
graphics to enhance understanding of a site, and may benefit from the level of language on a site not 
being unnecessarily complex for the site's intended purpose. </p> <br> <br>
 
<p>Seizure disorders: Some individuals with seizure disorders are triggered by visual flickering or 
audio signals at a certain frequency.<br>
To use the Web, people with seizure disorders may turn off animations, blinking text, or audio. Avoiding 
these visual or audio frequencies in Web sites prevents inadvertent triggering of seizures.<br> <br>

<b> 1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites </b> <br> <br>

<b> .AVI — Audio/Video Interleaved: </b> <p>  Standard video format supported on the windows platform. They do not 
stream, however, so you have to download the entire file before you can watch any of it.  </p> <br> 

<b>.CSS — Cascading StyleSheet: </b> <p>CSS files are a tool in the repertoire of webmasters that take care of 
how their websites look.  </p> <br> 

<b>DOC — Microsoft Word Document: </b> <p>Microsoft Word is the most popular word processing software in the world. 
You probably won’t come across loads of doc files, but if you do it can be annoying if you haven’t got a 
program that can open them. </p> <br>

<b>.EXE — EXEcutable file: </b>  <p>If you download a program that you need to install, it will likely come as an exe 
file.  </p> <br> <br>

<b>.GIF — Graphics Interchange Format: </b> <p>The most common image format on the Internet. Good for simple images. 
</p> <br> 

<b>.HTML/ .HTM — HyperText Markup Language file: </b> <p>Most pages you create for a website will be HTML files 
</p> <br>

<b>.JPG/ .JPEG — Joint Photographic Experts Group file: </b> <p>Another very common image file format, mainly used 
for photos.  </p> <br> 

<b>.MIDI/ .MID — Musical Instrument Digital Interface: </b> <p>Midis are sequenced music files made on keyboards. 
They’re usually really small and often sound great, although it largely depends on your soundcard.
</p> <br>

<b>.MP3 — MPEG Layer 3 sound file: </b> <p>MP3 is a sound file format which is highly compressed, which allows 
download-happy filesizes and excellent quality. </p>  <br> 

<b>.MPEG/ .MPG — Motion Picture Experts Group: </b> <p>file One of the standards for streaming movies.  
</p> <br> 

<b>.MOV/ .QT — QuickTime: </b> <p>The QuickTime format was designed by Apple and originated on the Mac, but has made
the transition to the PC and is hugely popular. </p>  <br>

<b>.PDF — Portable Document Format: </b> <p>Adobe Acrobat files were invented so that documents could be transferred 
between computers and indeed platforms, and still look the exact same, something which can’t be said about
 HTML files. </p> <br> 

<b>.PNG — Portable Network Graphics?: </b> <p>PNGs are a file format designed to be used in place of GIFs. They are 
usually slightly smaller, and sport advanced features like alpha-channel transparency and 24-bit colour 
support. </p>  <br> 

<b>.RAM — Real Audio Movie:  </b> <p>Real Networks created formats for streaming audio and video. 
</p>  <br> 

<b>.RAR — RAR archive: </b> <p>This is a compressed file format similar to the popular .zip format. 
</p> <br> 

<b>.TIFF — Tagged Image File Format: </b> <p>For really high quality images, TIFFs are used, but cannot be viewed 
through a browser. </p>  <br> 

<b>.TXT — TeXT file: </b> <p>The most basic text file.</p>  <br> 

<b>.WAV — WAVe sound file: </b> <p>A basic, either un- or not very- compressed sound file, usually used for short 
sound samples.  </p> <br> 

<b>.ZIP — ZIPped file: </b> <p>Zipped files are really groups of other types of files kept together and compressed 
a bit. <br>
