   <h1 class="large">ABOUT ME</h1> 
    <br>
   <h2 class="medium">Everything you ever wanted is on the other side of fear!!</h2> 
    <br>
 <br>
   <p>You mustâ€™ve  stopped here for a reason. I'm Gaelle Mokoy.
    I am 30 years young and decided to get into coding and web development after realising that:</p> <br>
    <ul> 
        <li>It is similar to marketing which I have a love and passion for.</li> 
        <li>I always love learning new skills. </li>
        <li>This could potentially be a career move where I can incorporate marketing and web development together.</li>
    </ul>
<br>
    <p>Doing something new is always a mixture of excitement and fear. With me it's always fear for the most part.
    Am I wasting my time? Am I gonna like it? Am I gonna be good at it? <br>
    <br>
    It all falls into place and becomes amazing when you realise that none of that matters, get out of your own head, 
    enjoy what you're learning and take it from there. <br>
    If you like it, great, if you don't enjoy it, great. You've tried something and developed skills that 99% of people in the UK
    do not have.
    <br>
    <br>    
    I am not in the habit of talking about myself often, but rather in the habit of showing off my skills in various ways. 
    I am trilingual, so if you need directions to the Eiffel tower or
    need to order a Castel beer in Kinshasa, or just want to enjoy a chinese 
    and watch saturday night takeway together. </p> <br>  <h2 class= "centred">I am the person just for you.</h2>
