1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business 
 <br>
 <br>
IT is a key factor for innovation and innovation is the path to business success and growth. Technology can be used for anything from data protection to communication to business lead generation
<br>
 <br>
Communications
In any organisation people communicate using technology. It could either be a VoIP phone system or emails,  running those communication systems as well as keeping the conversation secure is what IT is important for. Without them, it would be impossible to operate your business.
<br>
<br>
Inventory
Every business needs to be organized, to know when stock is low, and to be able to tell if things are going missing. With IT, additional stock can automatically be ordered when necessary, with inventory management system linked to the POS system, to keep this closed-loop running smoothly.
<br>
<br>
Data Storage
Office probably don’t have rows of filing cabinets anymore. Now, data is stored in the cloud or in some other digital server,which should be well-maintained and secure. 
<br>
<br>
Information Management
Data is kept so that it can be used to track sales, manage expenses, monitor activity, and maintain customer relationships. 
<br>

1.2  Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully 
<br>
<br>
In order to have  a successful project you would need to plan the project 
Identify the project 
Define goals and objectives 
Define tasks 
Build the team
Create a timeline 
Get feedback and adjust the project accordingly
<br>
<br>
Project Management Methodologies <br>
<br>
There are 7 project management methodologies. As there is not one size fits all  method as all projects differ in size, time and funding allocation. 
 
Agile -  Made up of 12 values and principles, Agile works best with projects that require flexibility, that are complex and uncertain.
 
Scrum - Comprises of 5 values: commitment courage, focus, openness and respect. Scrum is there to develop, deliver and sustain complex projects through collaboration, accountability  and iterative progress. 
 
Kanban - Has 6 general principles of practice which areVisualization
Limiting work in progress
Flow management
Making policies explicit
Using feedback loops
Collaborative or experimental evolution
Kanban works  by using visual cues that signal various stages of the development process. The cues involved in the process are a Kanban board, Kanban cards, and Kanban swimlanes for extra bit of organization.
Lean - Aims to provide more value whilst using less resources. It identifies three types of waste; muda, mura, and muri, also known as the 3Ms. Often mistaken for specializing in manufacturing industries, Lean methodology is ideal for any business or organization that is not looking for a process as such, but is interested in transforming how they conduct business.
 
Waterfall - is a linear, sequential design approach where progress flows downwards in one direction — like a waterfall. The methodology emphasizes that you’re only allowed to move onto the next phase once you have finished the current one.  The phases are followed in the following order:
System and software requirements
Analysis
Design
Coding
Testing
Operations
Waterfall is best suited for: Larger projects that require rigid stages and deadlines, or recurrent project where chances of surprises during the development process are relatively low.
 
Six Sigma - Aims to improve quality by reducing the number of errors in processes by identifying what is not working and then removing it from the process. It is best suited for larger organisations that want to improve quality and efficiency through a data-driven methodology.
 
PMBOK - Through the PMI, comes the PMBOK which is not quite a methodology but a guide detailing a set of standards that characterize project management.PMBOK stands for the Project Management Body of Knowledge and is a set of standard terminology and guidelines for project management. It states that there are five process groups that are prevalent in almost every project. Best suited for: Because it’s more of a reference guide than an actual project management methodology, you can’t implement PMI/PMBOK to a project. However, it can be used for when you want to weigh in on the best practices for your project.
 
Project Management Software
Although there is an array of softwares available, These are the ones I am familiar with.
Basecamp: With a simple interface, you can use this software to write to-do lists, create multiple projects, share files, schedule important dates, and have discussions.
Trello: let’s you organize to-do-lists and discussions visually through the use of collaborative board.
Zoho Projects: Comes equipped with tasks and milestones, calendar and meetings, time tracking, reports, forums, file storage, and even a chat-in app to improve collaboration.
Time Management
Delegate tasks. 
Prioritize your tasks. 
When you know which tasks are most important do those first and then order each task from most to least important. 
 1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your Trello board. 
 
1.4  Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why? 
Project failure can happen in any organization and to any project. There are an infinite number of reasons for failure. Sometimes it’s out of the control of a project manager and/or team members. Sometimes failure is controllable. 
Projects most commonly fail because there is a lack of attention and effort being applied to seven project performance factors:
Focus on business value, not technical detail. This involves establishing a clear link between the project and the organizations key strategic practices. The project plan needs to cover the planned delivery, the business change required and the means of benefits realization.
Establish clear accountability for measured results. It is necessary to establish a reasonably stable requirements baseline before any other work goes forward. Requirements may still continue to creep. In virtually all projects there will be some degree of “learning what the requirements really are” while building the project product.
Have consistent processes for managing unambiguous checkpoints. Successful projects typically have software measurement programs for capturing productivity and quality historical data that can be used to compare it against similar projects. The lack of effective quality centered mechanisms can be a major contributor to both cost and schedule overruns.
Have a consistent methodology for planning and executing projects. There should be a detailed plan developed before any release date of a project is announced. Inadequate planning is one of the major reasons why projects spin out of control.
Include the customer at the beginning of the project and continually involve the customer throughout. It has been observed that successful projects occur when end users (customers) and the project members work as teams. Projects are less likely to fail if there are informed customers giving meaningful input during every phase of the project. 
Manage and motivate people so that project efforts will experience a zone of optimal performance throughout its life. A project team made up of higher paid people with the right specialized skills is worth more per dollar than a group of lower cost people who need weeks or months of training before they can start to be productive.
Provide the project team members the tools and techniques the need to produce consistently successful projects. The project team must be skilled and experienced with clear defined roles and responsibilities. If not, there must be access to expertise which can benefit those fulfilling the requisite roles.
