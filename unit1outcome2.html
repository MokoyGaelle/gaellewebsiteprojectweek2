<h1><b>Unit 1 , Outcome 2 (Review)</b></h1>
 
<b>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with 
the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello </b>

<ul>
<li>Visual Studio Code (VSC)-  helped write the code for the website easily and clearly </li> <br>

<li>Trello  - Helped plan and analyze the project as well as assess the speed at which the plan is going </li> <br>

<li>Github - The latest version of the project is pushed onto Github at the end of the day </li> <br>
</ul>


<b> 2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello </b><br><br>

All three tools are very easy to use and simple to understand. It gives the ability to write simple code (VSC) that 
can be tested as an html format online to see any errors made to keep improving the code and the website design.  
Planning and analysis on Trello was fairly simple and straightforward as the lists complemented each other and showed me 
which step to take next. Github stopped me from creating several different versions of the same file as the latest version
 was always saved onto the platform. <br><br>

<b>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You 
    should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change? </b> <br>

<ul><li><b>Strengths: </b></li>
<ul>
<li>The  website is very simple, the information is clear and easy to read.</li> <br>
<li>The colours do not clash.</li> <br>
<li>The navigation is simple to use </li> <br>
<li>All the pictures are the correct size and well formatted.</li> <br>
<li>The internal links are working</li> </ul><br>
<br>
<li><b>Weakness: </b></li>
<ul>
<li>The site is not interactive enough, the images could’ve been in a carousel or a video could’ve been added.</li> <br>
<li>The headers on the page could’ve been used a little more </li> <br>
<li>The website is “safe” there no experimentation and it is very functional.</li> </ul></ul> 

As a whole the website is as desired and reflects my personality, simple with a lot of intricacies and straight to 
the point.<br> <br>

<b>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project. </b><br> <br>

The suggestions below are not so much improvements but rather suggestions on the development of the website. <br> <br>

<ul>
<li><b>Add videos - </b>  Videos on how the tools and softwares. For example:<br>
 <ul>
<li>how to create a Github account and doing a push at in order to save the latest version </li> <br>
<li>How to create a Trello project board and how to use it </li> <br>
<li>Using VSC from day one until the end of the project </li></ul>
<br>

<li><b>Change background - </b> use an image as a background so that the gallery is throughout the site rather than just in small 
sections of the websites.</li> <br> 
<li><b> Change the font - </b> use a font to give the website some -personally rather than using a standard font, for the site to be 
more feminine. For example use: </li> <br>

<ul>
<li>Dancing Script </li> <br>
<li>Great Vibes </li> <br>
<li>Parisienne </li> 
</ul> </ul>
<br> 

<b>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</b> <br> <br>

<b> Preparing appropriate content for your site:</b> Read up on project management,  as well  as the tools that were used during the project. 
Took the  time to understand how trello works and used it to make sure that every step of creating this website were completed.  <br> <br>

<b>Organise and combine information needed for web pages including different platforms:</b> The information was found several Project management 
website (references provided) as well as using VSC and Github to create the website and Trello for project planning. <br> <br>

<b>Select and using appropriate editing and formatting techniques for clarity and good navigation: </b> Using the correct coding language to create 
legible webpages rather than just one full page of information that will be difficult to read. Using the different heading on the  <br> <br>

<b> Select and use appropriate development techniques to link information across pages: </b>

<br> <br>

<b>Changing file formats for documents if necessary to display on your site error free pages that are fit for purpose:</b> Through VSC, the code is update where and when necessary to configure the outcome. Each web page is 
tested as HTML to see if every webpage is working correctly. Images were formatted in order to be the right size for the pages and to fit the sections 
of the site.
